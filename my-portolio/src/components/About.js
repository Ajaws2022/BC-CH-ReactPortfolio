                    My name is Alex Jaworski. I am a junior developer currently working on getting my full stack certification through the UCR Extensions bootcamp. I am excited to learn new technologies and enjoy new challenges. My goal is to find employment where I can take advantage of all the skills I've learned thus far. The greatest satisfaction in coding to me comes from overcoming hurdles and finding a creative and efficient way to do so. While I enjoy front end design I find back-end and server work far more enjoyable and look forward to furthering my skills in those areas.
