# A Simple React Portfolio
For this assignment we were tasked with redoing our portfolio using React. This involved creating react components, some of which were static and others controlled via the navbar which rendered the different pages using the BrowserRouter. In addition to creating the components we were given the unique tasks of creating a form to send messages to our email and creating a button or link to download a copy of our resume.

## Usage

The app can be cloned via your preffered method from GitHub into a repo. Once opened in a text editor 'npm i' will install the necessary packages, then 'npm run build' will create a browser ready version of the app. 'npm start' will start the page in the local browser for viewing.
